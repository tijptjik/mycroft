            <div class="innerPage">
            <p>The lectures for Mycroft Lectures are conceived and presented by Dr. Andrew Barker. Dr. Barker is an award-winning teacher who holds a Ph.D. in American Literature, a Master of Arts in Anglo Irish Literature and a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature. He has lectured on poetry at the University of Hong Kong, Baptist University, The Open University and Lingnan University. He also teaches at HKU’s School for Professional Adult Continuing Education, from whom he has received an Outstanding Teacher Award.
            <p>He is also the author of the poetry collection Snowblind from my Protective Coloring, available on Amazon, and has written for the Asian Literary Review.</p>

            <p>Mycroft Lectures select individual poems and explain those poems to you. We provide a clarification of what is happening in poems used on academic syllabi. With Mycroft Lectures you can immediately download a university-level lecture that specifically targets the poem you need. In the Mycroft Online Lecture you select, you will find the poem you wish to understand, analyzed sentence by sentence. The lectures explain what each line of a poem means by simplifying the language used by the poet. Where there is more than one possible interpretation for a poetic line, the lecture will present those interpretations, argue which are most plausible or interesting, and why this should be the case. Mycroft Lectures is an invaluable tool for students of all levels looking for corroboration of their own insights into a work, or for those seeking to understand the poem for the first time.</p>
            <p>It is our boast that even if you do not understand a poem before you download the lecture, after watching the lecture you should be able to explain it to someone else.</p>
            <p>Each download has a free three-minute excerpt for you to check the quality of lectures provided, and how applicable they are to your needs.</p>

                <h2>From Dr. Barker.</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="innerPage">
            <p>“I have taught poetry for nearly fifteen years, and it is apparent to me that a complication exists in the way such teaching is often done. Students are often taught examples of the form of a poem, the way the poem is written, while being given little information on the content of a poem, what the poem is actually about.</p>
            <p>I make this point often, but if you don’t understand what a poem is about you are unlikely to appreciate the specific wording the poet has selected to put what the poem is about across. To work out what the poem is about, ask yourself, ‘What does that line of poetry actually mean in simpler language?’ Once you can work that out you can much better appreciate the beauty of the wording chosen by the poet. Or not appreciate it, if you don’t like the poem.</p>
            <p>With Mycroft Lectures we have attempted to provide those lectures I thought would have been useful to me when I was a student. As a student, I would often ask of a poem, ‘I don’t understand this line. What does it mean?’ And the reply from teachers would often be, ‘What do you think it means?’ or ‘It means many different things.’ In hindsight, I suppose, my reply should have been, ‘I don’t know. That’s why I asked you,’ or ‘Well, tell me all the ones you can think of and I’ll see which one I find most persuasive,’ but there was then a teaching trend where the desire to get the student to work things out for themselves manifest as the teachers not answering questions put to them by students. I suspected the trend often masked the fact that the teachers simply didn’t know the answer to the questions they had been asked. It was only when I came across teachers who would, or could, translate a line of poetry into simpler language that I was able to understand poetry, and appreciate the beauty of the chosen wording in it. To help you understand poems in that way is the task Mycroft Lectures sets itself.</p>
            <p>The lectures also attempt to confront a specific question often put to teachers of poetry. Students have a tendency to read a poem, shrug and, if they are honest, ask: “Why should I like this?”</p>
            <p>At Mycroft Lectures we think we can provide an answer to that.</p>
