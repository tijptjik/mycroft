He straightened up\nTo drink it, then fell to right away\nNicking and slicing neatly, heaving sods\nOver his shoulder, digging down and down\nFor the good turf. Digging.\n\nThe cold smell of potato mold, the squelch and slap\nOf soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge\nThrough living roots awaken in my head.\nBut I've no spade to follow men like them.\n\nBetween my finger and my thumb\nThe squat pen rests.\nI'll dig with it.",

Snowdrops\nAnd candles soothed the bedside; I saw him\nFor the first time in six weeks. Paler now,\n\nWearing a poppy bruise on his left temple,\nHe lay in the four foot box as in his cot.\nNo gaudy scars, the bumper knocked him clear.\n\nA four foot box, a foot for every year. ",

      "text": "That’s my last Duchess painted on the wall, \nLooking as if she were alive. I call \nThat piece a wonder, now: Fra Pandolf’s hands \nWorked busily a day, and there she stands. \nWill’t please you sit and look at her? I said \n“Fra Pandolf” by design, for never read \nStrangers like you that pictured countenance, \nThe depth and passion of its earnest glance, \nBut to myself they turned (since none puts by \nThe curtain I have drawn for you, but I) \nAnd seemed as they would ask me, if they durst, \nHow such a glance came there; so, not the first \nAre you to turn and ask thus. Sir, ’twas not \nHer husband’s presence only, called that spot \nOf joy into the Duchess’ cheek: perhaps \nFra Pandolf chanced to say “Her mantle laps \nOver my lady’s wrist too much,” or “Paint \nMust never hope to reproduce the faint \nHalf-flush that dies along her throat”: such stuff \nWas courtesy, she thought, and cause enough \nFor calling up that spot of joy. She had \nA heart—how shall I say?—too soon made glad, \nToo easily impressed; she liked whate’er \nShe looked on, and her looks went everywhere. \nSir, ’twas all one! My favour at her breast, \nThe dropping of the daylight in the West, \nThe bough of cherries some officious fool \nBroke in the orchard for her, the white mule \nShe rode with round the terrace—all and each \nWould draw from her alike the approving speech, \nOr blush, at least. She thanked men,—good! but thanked \nSomehow—I know not how—as if she ranked \nMy gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name \nWith anybody’s gift. Who’d stoop to blame \nThis sort of trifling? Even had you skill \nIn speech—(which I have not)—to make your will \nQuite clear to such an one, and say, “Just this \nOr that in you disgusts me; here you miss, \nOr there exceed the mark”—and if she let \nHerself be lessoned so, nor plainly set \nHer wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse, \n—E’en then would be some stooping; and I choose \nNever to stoop. Oh sir, she smiled, no doubt, \nWhene’er I passed her; but who passed without \nMuch the same smile? This grew; I gave commands; \nThen all smiles stopped together. There she stands \nAs if alive. Will’t please you rise? We’ll meet \nThe company below, then. I repeat, \nThe Count your master’s known munificence \nIs ample warrant that no just pretence \nOf mine for dowry will be disallowed; \nThough his fair daughter’s self, as I avowed \nAt starting, is my object. Nay, we’ll go \nTogether down, sir. Notice Neptune, though, \nTaming a sea-horse, thought a rarity, \nWhich Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me!",

However, it doesn’t take a genius to see that the Mycroft online lectures really can benefit my second-language students. They find English language poetry extremely challenging, and for my MA and undergraduate students it is essential for them to have some exposure to the cultural experience of poetry in English as well as in Chinese, if they are to appreciate poetry translation in both language directions. The Mycroft lectures have really succeeded in opening up the world of English language poetry to my students. Thanks to the happy blend of clarity and analytical rigour evident in the structure and execution of the lectures, we now have a valuable self-study aid as well as a dynamic teaching tool in class. For Translation students this is an ideal study aid because the lectures draw them into the world of the poem, clearly explicating the cultural background, the metaphors and layers of meaning, the language devices and subtext, as well as offering insights into the personality of the poet and the wider context of the poem. I recommend the Mycroft lectures on poetry very strongly for fellow teachers of literature both to whet the appetite for and stimulate the interest in poetry among their students and, at the same time, provide a practical resource for those who find English language poetry rather forbidding. A valuable addition to the world of online resources, Mycroft’s excellence lies in its attention to every detail of the student’s fundamental needs in the understanding and appreciation of an impressive range of famous English poems.

He blends the seriousness of the literary critic with the intimate exuberance of a poet; so, it is a delight to watch him explain a love poem by hauling John Donne from the seventeenth century to a contemporary milieu, or, hear him shrewdly unwrap the layers of meaning in Seamus Heaney’s Digging.\r\n\r\nMycroft lectures include a comprehensive selection of poems many of which are on the English literature syllabi of several Indian universities. Apart from understanding the contexts, nuances, metaphors and poetic devices incorporated in the poems, students will also immensely benefit from observing the language and method employed to discuss poetry.\r\n\r\nThese poetry lectures can also be incorporated in ESL classrooms to wean away students from the preconceived notion that language learning is merely gaining command over a set of communication skills, and to give these students a taste of English literature, to allow them to partake of its beauty and its brilliance.

Maybe this is not supposed to play but market the form of content.   But either way a little confusing since my expectation of something playing wasn't satisfied.  I also tried to play some excerpts but nothing happened.  Perhaps some temporary tech issue but good idea to enable some sampling.  \r\n\r\nListen, I haven't been in student in while but I would imagine that your content has some value.   Can that value be monetized and if yes, how to do so is the question.   I'm doubtful of the individual purchaser because of expectation of free on the internet as well as difficulty to market to that group.  So as we talked about I think you are right that selling to institutions is the way to go.   \r\n\r\nOk institutional model:  how to sell to schools?  Schools as you know are bureaucratic and cheap.   I think you need to carefully consider how schools typically make a purchase.   I suspect that they have to jump through some hoops and justify internally.  And which person is really the target?  Professor?  Department head?  other?     I think you need to zero in like a laser on the who, value proposition to them, and the how in which they can effectively and realistically become a paying customer.   For example, listing $500 institutional price on the website you may want to reconsider.  Could scare them off right away.    Perhaps give them some limited  time or part of archive for free.  You might need a free to upsell other content type of model.    Also, assuming I am department head buyer, for example, tell me exactly how you are benefiting me and my professors?  \r\n\r\nAnyway, now that I have seen let's discuss further next I see you in gym and have a proper exchange.\r\n\r\nChris\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Also there were conducted a dozens of experiments   which revealed a positive effect of links from social media and in particular positive effect of Twitter to the position of the site, which is supported by a statement of technical engineer Matt Cuts about the fact that Google takes into account the links from social media like Twitter and Facebook in determining of the site positions in a search - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofhwPC-5Ub4&feature=player_embedded\nSo, if you want your site to be on the top in a search, it is necessary to have quality links from Twitter and other social media.\n\nAnd that is actually what I want to offer you:\n\nPlacement of tweets and retweets with links to different pages of your site mycroftlectures.com in more than 500 different, high-quality user accounts on Twitter.

Would you like to promote your products and services directly to a target audience?\nAt the moment, interaction between the companies and their potential and existing customers is carried out through social media.\n\nI offer two types of services:\n\n1) Creation and promotion of the Twitter-channel for your website mycroftlectures.com: addendum of active followers (friends) in an amount not less than 1500, who will retweet(display in their Twitters) almost all of your tweets(messages), giving the channel a status of \"Top\".\nWhat gives the status \"Top\"? All your tweets will have an advantage in the search upon requests on the topic of your website and will be shown in the status of \"Top\", and not in the general search which has the status \"All\" as occurs with ordinary channels. Your twitter will be recommended to add as friend to other users of twitter system with similar interests including those from your region. \nSince the format of Twitter implies just short messages with further obtaining of complete information after the following of links - this is a great opportunity of attraction a new audience to your website and new customers.\nCost of the service - $ 70.\n\n2) Placement of links of your website on 500 high quality twitter accounts.
