He straightened up\nTo drink it, then fell to right away\nNicking and slicing neatly, heaving sods\nOver his shoulder, digging down and down\nFor the good turf. Digging.\n\nThe cold smell of potato mold, the squelch and slap\nOf soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge\nThrough living roots awaken in my head.\nBut I've no spade to follow men like them.\n\nBetween my finger and my thumb\nThe squat pen rests.\nI'll dig with it.",

Snowdrops\nAnd candles soothed the bedside; I saw him\nFor the first time in six weeks. Paler now,\n\nWearing a poppy bruise on his left temple,\nHe lay in the four foot box as in his cot.\nNo gaudy scars, the bumper knocked him clear.\n\nA four foot box, a foot for every year. ",

I call \nThat piece a wonder, now: Fra Pandolf’s hands \nWorked busily a day, and there she stands. \nWill’t please you sit and look at her? I said \n“Fra Pandolf” by design, for never read \nStrangers like you that pictured countenance, \nThe depth and passion of its earnest glance, \nBut to myself they turned (since none puts by \nThe curtain I have drawn for you, but I) \nAnd seemed as they would ask me, if they durst, \nHow such a glance came there; so, not the first \nAre you to turn and ask thus. Sir, ’twas not \nHer husband’s presence only, called that spot \nOf joy into the Duchess’ cheek: perhaps \nFra Pandolf chanced to say “Her mantle laps \nOver my lady’s wrist too much,” or “Paint \nMust never hope to reproduce the faint \nHalf-flush that dies along her throat”: such stuff \nWas courtesy, she thought, and cause enough \nFor calling up that spot of joy. She had \nA heart—how shall I say?—too soon made glad, \nToo easily impressed; she liked whate’er \nShe looked on, and her looks went everywhere. \nSir, ’twas all one! My favour at her breast, \nThe dropping of the daylight in the West, \nThe bough of cherries some officious fool \nBroke in the orchard for her, the white mule \nShe rode with round the terrace—all and each \nWould draw from her alike the approving speech, \nOr blush, at least. She thanked men,—good! but thanked \nSomehow—I know not how—as if she ranked \nMy gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name \nWith anybody’s gift. Who’d stoop to blame \nThis sort of trifling? Even had you skill \nIn speech—(which I have not)—to make your will \nQuite clear to such an one, and say, “Just this \nOr that in you disgusts me; here you miss, \nOr there exceed the mark”—and if she let \nHerself be lessoned so, nor plainly set \nHer wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse, \n—E’en then would be some stooping; and I choose \nNever to stoop. Oh sir, she smiled, no doubt, \nWhene’er I passed her; but who passed without \nMuch the same smile? This grew; I gave commands; \nThen all smiles stopped together. There she stands \nAs if alive. Will’t please you rise? We’ll meet \nThe company below, then. I repeat, \nThe Count your master’s known munificence \nIs ample warrant that no just pretence \nOf mine for dowry will be disallowed; \nThough his fair daughter’s self, as I avowed \nAt starting, is my object. Nay, we’ll go \nTogether down, sir. Notice Neptune, though, \nTaming a sea-horse, thought a rarity, \nWhich Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me!",

Dr Barker’s subject expertise and enthusiasm for poetry shines through in these informative, insightful and original lecturettes. The beauty of this site is that students can glean greater understanding and appreciation of great anglophone poetry at both secondary school and university undergraduate level. Such a combination of range and depth is rare and valuable for people who care about literature pedagogy and also for those who seek to enter the world of the poetic imagination. Highly recommended!",

      "text": "Mycroft is, as we all know from the Sherlock Holmes stories, Sherlock’s even smarter brother. However, it doesn’t take a genius to see that the Mycroft online lectures really can benefit my second-language students. They find English language poetry extremely challenging, and for my MA and undergraduate students it is essential for them to have some exposure to the cultural experience of poetry in English as well as in Chinese, if they are to appreciate poetry translation in both language directions. The Mycroft lectures have really succeeded in opening up the world of English language poetry to my students. Thanks to the happy blend of clarity and analytical rigour evident in the structure and execution of the lectures, we now have a valuable self-study aid as well as a dynamic teaching tool in class. For Translation students this is an ideal study aid because the lectures draw them into the world of the poem, clearly explicating the cultural background, the metaphors and layers of meaning, the language devices and subtext, as well as offering insights into the personality of the poet and the wider context of the poem. I recommend the Mycroft lectures on poetry very strongly for fellow teachers of literature both to whet the appetite for and stimulate the interest in poetry among their students and, at the same time, provide a practical resource for those who find English language poetry rather forbidding. A valuable addition to the world of online resources, Mycroft’s excellence lies in its attention to every detail of the student’s fundamental needs in the understanding and appreciation of an impressive range of famous English poems. Thoroughly recommended for my Hong Kong as well as for international students in general!",

It is indeed, very helpful resource for the students as well as teachers of English literature. Most of the poems you have dealt are in curriculum of Indian universities.\r\n\r\nWhat I liked:\r\n\r\n- Slow and steady pace of your speech –helpful to students and grasping the ideas…\r\n- Some lines of poems written on the screen –this is very good… and I hope the entire poem must be visible to the viewers in full video.\r\n- Analysis is quite up to the mark of university level.\r\n\r\nA valuable resource and an excellent work by Dr. Andrew Barker",

      "text": "Reminiscent of John Keating in Dead Poets Society, Dr Andrew Barker approaches poetry with a passion that draws the student/viewer to engage with the poem not just as a text to be understood with the aid of annotations but as an experience. He blends the seriousness of the literary critic with the intimate exuberance of a poet; so, it is a delight to watch him explain a love poem by hauling John Donne from the seventeenth century to a contemporary milieu, or, hear him shrewdly unwrap the layers of meaning in Seamus Heaney’s Digging.\r\n\r\nMycroft lectures include a comprehensive selection of poems many of which are on the English literature syllabi of several Indian universities. Apart from understanding the contexts, nuances, metaphors and poetic devices incorporated in the poems, students will also immensely benefit from observing the language and method employed to discuss poetry.\r\n\r\nThese poetry lectures can also be incorporated in ESL classrooms to wean away students from the preconceived notion that language learning is merely gaining command over a set of communication skills, and to give these students a taste of English literature, to allow them to partake of its beauty and its brilliance. I recommend these lectures strongly and I believe that they will be amazing teaching resources in English language classrooms.",

Should the poem lectured on not be on the syllabus your school is addressing the analysis within the lecture will still provide invaluable ‘tools’ for examination of poems within the syllabus. To this end, teachers may select not to show a full lecture but to select section they feel address areas they wish to cover in class.</p>\r\n<p>The lectures are designed to appeal to and be useful to a wide section of students. Some students will find them easier than others and disagreement about the most interesting interpretation of a poem for discussion among students is encouraged within the lectures themselves.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, though we have been very careful to ensure the lectures are easy to understand and cover explanations of the poems, these lectures contain very little “fat.” Each lecture contains a lot of information. Students at school or college level will be able to understand the poems after watching the lectures. Students at university level will find new points for consideration and analysis.</p>\r\n<p>Remember, once you have listened Mycroft for a semester all the lectures can be viewed as many times as you wish for all staff and all students.</p>",
